Before opening any job URLs, confirm the OpenClaw browser control service is reachable (gateway running, browser profile connected) so the automation can interact with the page; if the service is unreachable fail fast and log the condition for Gary to restart. Use the runbooks (job-seeker/runbooks/CRON_RUNBOOK.md and BACKFILL_RUNBOOK.md) for the full flow and for how to refresh snapshots/selectors when the apply button (e.g., ref e12) moves.\n\nFor each job, open the listed URL, walk the application flow, answer every pre-screening question referencing indeed-clean-resume.pdf (Senior Full-Stack Engineer, 14+ years, React/Next.js/Vue front ends, Node/TypeScript services, solid DevOps/CI/CD, Calgary/remote availability), and capture the question+answer in the tracker notes. When ready to submit, set applied_at to the current timestamp, and if you hit CAPTCHAs, 2FA, or any manual gate, stop there, note the blocker, and mention it in the final summary. After all apply rows are handled, send Gary a Telegram recap with how many you processed, which ones completed (include job links), which still need manual follow-up, and a concise recap of the pre-screen answers; mention blockers explicitly. Keep everything inside the browser profile (no web_fetch).",
