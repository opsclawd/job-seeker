    "message": "GIT SYNC: `cd /home/gary/.openclaw/workspace && git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main && git clean -fd` before each run so the working tree mirrors `main`.\n\nBROWSER: Use ONLY the OpenClaw-managed browser profile named 'openclaw'. Do NOT use the 'chrome' profile, Browser Relay, or any Chrome extension-attached tab flow. Preflight: call browser.status/snapshot using profile=openclaw; if unreachable, stop and report that the openclaw browser is not available.\n\nMorning Apply Run: Each execution should first select the single oldest row in /home/gary/.openclaw/workspace/data/tracker.csv with status=apply and no applied_at timestamp. If none exists, immediately fall back to the single oldest row with status=maybe and no applied_at timestamp. If neither queue has eligible rows, report no work and stop. Before opening the job URL, confirm the OpenClaw browser control service is reachable (gateway running, browser profile connected); if it isn't, fail fast so Gary can restart it before the next attempt. Use the runbooks (job-seeker/runbooks/CRON_RUNBOOK.md and BACKFILL_RUNBOOK.md) for the full flow and for how to refresh snapshots/selectors when the apply button (e.g., ref e12) moves.\n\nOpen that job URL, follow the application flow, answer every pre-screening question referencing indeed-clean-resume.pdf (Senior Full-Stack Engineer, 14+ years, React/Next.js/Vue front ends, Node/TypeScript services, solid DevOps/CI/CD, Calgary/remote availability), and capture the question+answer in the tracker notes. When ready to submit, set applied_at to the current timestamp, and if you hit CAPTCHAs, 2FA, or any manual gate, stop there, note the blocker, and mention it in the final summary.\n\nTRACKER PUSH (required): If you changed `data/tracker.csv` (e.g., set applied_at / appended notes), commit and push **directly to `main`** (no PRs):\n- `cd /home/gary/.openclaw/workspace`\n- `git pull --ff-only origin main` (fail if not fast-forward)\n- `git add data/tracker.csv && git commit -m \"tracker: update after morning-apply\"` (only if there are changes)\n- `git push origin main`\nDo NOT leave tracker changes only in the working tree; the next cron run will reprocess stale state if `main` isn’t updated.\n\nAfter that single job is handled, send Gary a Telegram recap with the completed link, the pre-screen answers, and any required manual follow-up; mention blockers explicitly. Keep everything inside the browser profile (no web_fetch).",
