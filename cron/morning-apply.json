Do NOT use the 'chrome' profile, Browser Relay, or any Chrome extension-attached tab flow. Preflight: call browser.status/snapshot using profile=openclaw; if unreachable, stop and report that the openclaw browser is not available.\n\nMorning Apply Run: Each execution works the single oldest row in ~/projects/job-seeker/data/tracker.csv with status=apply and no applied_at timestamp. Before opening the job URL, confirm the OpenClaw browser control service is reachable (gateway running, browser profile connected); if it isn't, fail fast so Gary can restart it before the next attempt. Use the runbooks (job-seeker/runbooks/CRON_RUNBOOK.md and BACKFILL_RUNBOOK.md) for the full flow and for how to refresh snapshots/selectors when the apply button (e.g., ref e12) moves.\n\nOpen that job URL, follow the application flow, answer every pre-screening question referencing indeed-clean-resume.pdf (Senior Full-Stack Engineer, 14+ years, React/Next.js/Vue front ends, Node/TypeScript services, solid DevOps/CI/CD, Calgary/remote availability), and capture the question+answer in the tracker notes. When ready to submit, set applied_at to the current timestamp, and if you hit CAPTCHAs, 2FA, or any manual gate, stop there, note the blocker, and mention it in the final summary.

TRACKER PUSH (required): If you changed `data/tracker.csv` (e.g., set applied_at / appended notes), you must commit those changes and push them to `main` via a branch + PR (squash-merge + delete branch). Do NOT leave tracker changes only in the working tree; the next cron run will reprocess stale state if `main` isn’t updated.

After that single job is handled, send Gary a Telegram recap with the completed link, the pre-screen answers, and any required manual follow-up; mention blockers explicitly. Keep everything inside the browser profile (no web_fetch).",
