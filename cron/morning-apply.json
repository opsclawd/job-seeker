Before opening the job URL, confirm the OpenClaw browser control service is reachable (gateway running, browser profile connected); if it isn't, fail fast so Gary can restart it before the next attempt. Use the runbooks (job-seeker/runbooks/CRON_RUNBOOK.md and BACKFILL_RUNBOOK.md) for the full flow and for how to refresh snapshots/selectors when the apply button (e.g., ref e12) moves.\n\nOpen that job URL, follow the application flow, answer every pre-screening question referencing indeed-clean-resume.pdf (Senior Full-Stack Engineer, 14+ years, React/Next.js/Vue front ends, Node/TypeScript services, solid DevOps/CI/CD, Calgary/remote availability), and capture the question+answer in the tracker notes. When ready to submit, set applied_at to the current timestamp, and if you hit CAPTCHAs, 2FA, or any manual gate, stop there, note the blocker, and mention it in the final summary. After that single job is handled, send Gary a Telegram recap with the completed link, the pre-screen answers, and any required manual follow-up; mention blockers explicitly. Keep everything inside the browser profile (no web_fetch).",
