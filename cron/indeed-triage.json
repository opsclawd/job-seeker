Visit each Indeed query URL listed in ~/projects/job-seeker/streams/indeed/QUERIES.md (Calgary, last 30 days, sort by date). For each listing: open the job page (viewjob?jk=...), de-dupe by jk against ~/projects/job-seeker/data/tracker.csv, read the job description, write a short JD-based summary into the tracker notes, and set status apply/new/maybe/skip (manager roles=maybe; Salesforce-only=skip; DevOps-heavy=skip; unrelated=skip). Append new rows and commit+push changes to opsclawd/job-seeker. Finally, send Gary a short summary: counts added by status + top apply links."
