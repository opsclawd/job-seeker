Preflight: call browser.status or browser.snapshot using profile=openclaw; if unreachable, stop immediately and report that the openclaw browser control service is not available.\n\nDaily Job Triage Run: Check for new listings matching queries in `/home/gary/.openclaw/workspace/streams/indeed/QUERIES.md` (last 24 hours). Use the openclaw browser profile to visit each query URL, open each job page (viewjob?jk=...), de-dupe by jk against `/home/gary/.openclaw/workspace/data/tracker.csv`, read the job description, write a short JD-based summary into the tracker notes, and set status apply/new/maybe/skip (manager roles=maybe; Salesforce-only=skip; DevOps-heavy=skip; unrelated=skip). Append new rows and commit+push changes to opsclawd/job-seeker on a branch, then open a PR and immediately squash-merge + delete the branch (so `main` is updated before the next cron run). Finally, `git pull --ff-only` so the local workspace is back on `main`. Send Gary a short summary: counts added by status + top apply links, and confirm the PR was merged.",
